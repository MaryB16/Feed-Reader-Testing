# Feed-Reader-Testing
This is the 5th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Description
For this project udacity has provided web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The purpose of this project was to write a series of tests against a given application using Jasmine as the testing framework.

### Jasmine version
This project was done using the latest version of [Jasmine (3.1.0)](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/global). Older versions of Jasmine might not work due to newer API Jasmine features that were used in this project.

## Instructions
Download or clone the project on your computer then open `index.html`. After the feeds finish loading, the Jasmine tests should appear on the bottom of the webpage.
