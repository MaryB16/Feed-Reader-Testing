# Feed-Reader-Testing
This is the 5th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Description
For this project Udacity has provided a web app that reads RSS feeds. The purpose of this project was to write a series of tests against a given application using Jasmine as the testing framework.

### Jasmine version
This project uses the latest version of [Jasmine (3.1.0)](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/global).

## Instructions
Download or clone the project on your computer then open `index.html` in your favorite browser. After the feeds finish loading, the Jasmine tests should appear on the bottom of the webpage.
